A full reimplementation of The Sims Online, using Monogame. FreeSO aims to be faithful to the original game as well as include quality of life changes such as hardware rendering, Hi-res output and >2 floor houses. 

FreeSO currently depends on the original game files (objects, avatars, ui) to function, which are available for download from EA servers.
